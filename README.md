# JMH microbenchmarks for OT/J 

This is a set of microbenchmarks for OT/J using the JMH benchmarking harness.


## Build and run

First of all, the build *only works with JDK 8*, but you can run the resulting benchmark with a
a more recent JDK.

Disclaimer: This project uses an ugly hybrid Ant/Maven build, because at the moment, there seems to
be no reliable way to build OT/J projects with Maven. Therefore, some JARs from the official OT/J
distribution (licensed under the Eclipse Public License v1.0) are included. For convenience, it also
ships with an Eclipse project file for easier editing. Note that the benchmark cannot and should
not be executed from inside the IDE.

In order to build the "payload" (OT/J and Ant) and the benchmark (JMH and Maven), just use:

    make

which calls Ant and Maven in sequence.

The benchmarks are executed as follows:

    ./run_benchmarks.sh
    ./run_benchmarks_nootj.sh

The latter one runs the benchmarks with the OT/J runtime *disabled*.


## Runtime options

Use the `-help` option of `run_benchmark_*.sh` to see which options the JMH runner accepts.
Here are some useful ones:

- `./run_benchmarks.sh -jvmArgsAppend '-Dot.dump'` enables OT/J dumping of weaved classes into
  the `otdyn` directory
- `./run_benchmarks.sh -prof stack` enables simple stack profiling
- `./run_benchmarks.sh -jvmArgsAppend '-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+PrintInlining'` to see
  the inlining decisions of the Hotspot VM
- `./run_benchmarks.sh -jvmArgsAppend '-XX:CompileCommand=dontinline,path.to.Class::methodName'`
  to disallow inlining of the specified method.
